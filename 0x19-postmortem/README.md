stmortem Inccident Report

### Issue Summary:
        ##### Duration:
                - Start Time: November 10, 2023, 14:30 UTC.
                - End Time: November 10, 2023, 18:45 UTC.
        ##### Impact:
                - The user authentication service experienced a complete outage.
                - 80% of users were unable to log in during the incident, resulting in a significant service disruption.
### Timeline:

        ##### Detection Time:
                - November 10, 2023, 14:30 UTC
                - Detection Method:
                - An automated monitoring alert indicated a sudden spike in failed authentication requests.
        ##### Actions Taken:
                - Initial investigation focused on the authentication server logs to identify potential issues.
                - Assumed the issue might be related to a recent code deployment.
        ##### Misleading Paths:
                - Initially suspected a database overload due to high traffic, leading to excessive authentication attempts.
                - Explored potential DDoS attacks, analyzing network traffic patterns.
        ##### Escalation:
                - Incident was escalated to the System Operations team after initial investigations failed to reveal the root cause.
        ##### Resolution:
                - Identified a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings that resulted in uneven distribution of authentication requests.
                - Load balancer settings were corrected, and service was gradually restored by redistributing traffic evenly.

### Root Cause and Resolution:

        ##### Root Cause:
                - The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused uneven distribution of authentication requests, overwhelming specific server instances.
        ##### Resolution:
                - Load balancer settings were corrected to evenly distribute incoming authentication requests across all available servers.
                - Implemented additional monitoring to detect and alert on load balancer configuration changes.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures:

        ##### Improvements/Fixes:
                - Regularly review and audit load balancer configurations to ensure proper distribution of traffic.
                - Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time alerts on load balancer configuration changes.
        ##### Tasks to Address the Issue:
                - Implement automated testing of load balancer configurations in the CI/CD pipeline to catch potential misconfigurations before deployment.
                - Conduct a comprehensive review of the incident response process to identify areas for improvement.
                - Enhance documentation regarding load balancer configuration and its impact on system performance.
                - Provide additional training for the operations team on load balancer management and troubleshooting.

### Conclusion:
        - The web stack outage was a result of a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to a disproportionate distribution of authentication requests. The incident was promptly detected through monitoring, and corrective actions were taken to resolve the issue and prevent its recurrence. To further enhance system reliability, ongoing improvements in load balancer management, monitoring, and incident response processes will be implemented. This incident underscores the importance of robust monitoring and proactive maintenance to ensure the seamless operation of critical web services.
